# gsuba-fusion
Greenville Associates Fusion Shell

This shell provides a Targeted Windows System to provide javascript, HML5, PHP, Custom Microsoft(.ASPX), and Adobe Cold Fusion binaries to work in an integrated web framework. The Shell also hides the complexity of the software solution from the search bar, making it much friendlier to computer security architects.

In General the Gsuba-fusion shell provides a Commerical Desktop Experience to web applications. The GSuba Shell also installs PHP Driven Web solutions from Joomla, Drupal, and Worpdress out of the box allowing non-developers the ability to complete their marketing tasks on a very sophisticated platform.

We can rebuild corporate Lanscapes at Levels as low as three deep using Image Maps, combined with a Joomla datastore. The default install includes a Header and Footer File which can be customized to meet your business needs. (fheader.html), and (ffooter.html).

In the first release we are offering a fixed web platform of 1200px x Unlimited, but the system fixes the bottom bar to a corporate logo offering a much more sophisticated marketing delivery.
