<!-- Baseline - Fusion Shell - V1 - Fixed Width - 1260px - Page

! Fusion Shell Draws a Screen which doesnt vary by the content - Just like Legacy MS Developer Tools - Visual Basic Etc - With a HTML/JQuery Menu System.
! Fusion Shell Makes the Intranet/and LAN Applications Looks Similar Making Users Much More Comfortable.

! This is fixed at the Least Common Demonimator of your Intranet. (Your Worst Monitor).
! Legacy sites typically use 1260px including Joomla, and thus there is good science here.
! SVGA Resolution is usually 1200x800px depth. Fusion Shell does not limit Pixel Height only width and Presents a Bottom Logo Bar.
! This dramatically improves the Brand Presentation for your company over single Page Websites from Worpdress... which we feel are Inadequate for most companies.
